My study program on Android

Simple program to allow study away from the computer.
Guides study by drawing random questions or answers with ones unknown being more likely drawn.

Todo:
Implement in app flashcard additions (currently loaded from xml)
Allow different sets of flashcards for multiple areas of study (this personal project only contains java / OOP questions)
